# Liquidity Management for Orca Whirlpools

The smart contract aims to eliminate the tedious manual selection of whirlpools parameters with the creation of a vault which manages the price range for the liquidity, based on historical data, and autocompound fees and rewards. In this way, besides obtaining more fees, all users will receive the same LP-token (an spl-token) instead of the Whirlpools NFT, increasing thus the composability of the entire ecosystem.
